In my case, it was due to passing 'index' to the draggable components that were changing with re-rendering.
So, pass index that constantly represent the same component even after the rendering.

I WAS GETTING THESE TWO ERRORS-

[React beautiful DND: Detected non-consecutive indexes]
Invariant failed: Cannot finish a drop animating when no drop is occurring
I fixed the 1st one and the other one got fixed too.

Uncaught runtime errors:
